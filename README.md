File and Folder
The CpGI_fat.jar is GUI tool for ClusterPSO program.

Input parameters
Double click to run the program, and then input the following parameter 

1.	load file button is help to open the dataset for ClusterPSO program implementation. For example, when using supplementary test data set placed in “D:\ClusterPSO_GUI\data\NT_113952.1.fasta” please input the data path “D:\ClusterPSO_GUI\data\NT_113952_1.txt”
2.	contig sequence is the contig sequence which is defined as 0 or 1. If user want to predict CpG islands from contig sequence that user will set 0, otherwise set 1.
3.	distance threshold is the distance threshold between adjacent CpG dinucleotides within array.
4.	p-value is the significance level (e.g. 0.01) for the cluster, which indicates a potential for the presence of island within the detected cluster.
5.	population is the population size of particle swarm optimization.
6.	generation is the generation number of particle swarm optimization.
7.	run button is help to implement the ClusterPSO program.
8.	The save button will output the figure to the “D:\ClusterPSO_GUI\data\picture name”. The user can save another picture name for the CpG island prediction figure.
